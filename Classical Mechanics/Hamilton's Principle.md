The path a particle takes between two points between a given time interval is one the minimizes the action, a quantity defined as

$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal{L}(q, \dot{q}, t) dt
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is [[The Lagrangian]] and $q$ is the set of [[Generalized Coordinates]]. This means that whichever path minimizes the integral of the Lagrangian over the given period of time is the desired path for the particle. This is an application of [[Variational Principles]] or the calculus of variations.
