The Euler-Lagrange equations are the second order equations of motion for a system derived from [[The Lagrangian]]. Given a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$, the equations are

$$
\dot{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{q}}} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial q}
$$

for a set of [[Generalized Coordinates]] $q$.
