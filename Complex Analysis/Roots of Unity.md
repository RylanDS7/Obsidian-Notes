The $n^{th}$ roots of unity are the set of complex numbers satisfying the equation

$$
z^{n} = 1
$$

which are given by 

$$
z = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} = \text{exp}\bigg(\frac{2k\pi i}{n}\bigg)
$$

For $k = 0, 1, ... , n-1$.

These solutions are the complex numbers of magnitude $1$ that divide the unit circle into $n$ equal parts starting at the positive real axis. For example, the twelfth roots of unity are shown graphically below.

An important thing to note is that there are exactly $n$ roots of unity for a given $n$. In other words, there are exactly $n$ solutions to the equation $z^n= 1$, which is a fact that follows from the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]]. For higher $k$ values beyond $n-1$, the roots of unity will begin repeating solutions.
