For a closed curve $\alpha$ that is completely holomorphic in its interior, 

$$
\oint_\alpha \frac{f(z)}{z-w}dz = 2\pi i f(w)
$$

for any $w \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $w \in int(\alpha)$.


By [[Cauchy's Theorem]], holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable so it follows that

$$
\oint_\alpha \frac{f(z)}{(z-w)^{n+1}}dz = \frac{2\pi i f^{(n)}(w)}{n!}
$$

which is obtained by taking the derivative with respect to w.
