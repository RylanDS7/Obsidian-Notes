For a function $f$ holomorphic on the domain $\Omega$, if $f$ is not constant, then $|f(z)|$ does not reach a maximum on $\Omega$. Furthermore, if $\Omega$ is bounded, with $f$ also being continuous on the boundary of $\Omega$, then $|f(z)|$ must reach its maximum on the boundary. Mathematically,

$$
\text{max}\{|f(z)| : z \in \Omega \cup \partial \Omega\} = \text{max}\{|f(z)| : z \in \partial \Omega\}
$$

and

$$
|f(w)| < \text{max}\{|f(z)| : z \in \partial \Omega\} \quad \text{for all} \ w \in \Omega
$$
