For a holomorphic function $f$ on $B_r(z_0)$, $f$ necessarily has an antiderivative on $B_r(z_0)$. This is true generally for all domains in $\mathbb{C}$ as long as the function is holomorphic everywhere in the domain.

Another way to view this theorem is that functions have infinite antiderivatives as long as they have infinite derivatives, and the other way around.

This theorem implies that a contour integral across a holomorphic domain depends only on the endpoints. A Collaroy to this is that a closed contour integral that encloses a fully holomorphic domain must be equal to zero. This is the complex equivalent for the [[First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]].

The important consequences of this Theorem include:
- [[Cauchy's Integral Formula]]
- [[Mean Value Property]]
- [[Maximum Modulus Principle]]
- [[Minimum Modulus Principle]]
- [[Liouville's Theorem]]
- [[Rouch√©'s Theorem]]
- [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]]
