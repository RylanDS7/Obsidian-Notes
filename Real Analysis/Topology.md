The topology of a space is simply the set of all subsets of the space which are defined to be [[Open Sets]].

On $\mathbb{R}^k$, the usual topology is given by the set of all subsets which have the property that an open ball can be found inside the subset to contain each point in it.

[[Neighborhoods]] of a point are defined in terms of sets in the topology.

[[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]] are "well behaved" topologies that obey certain axioms.
