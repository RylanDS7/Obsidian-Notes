Series are defined as the sequence of partial sums of a given sequence,
$$
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^na_k
$$
This sequence converges when the sequence of partial sums converge (according to the [[Formal Definition of Limits]]), the limit is written
$$
S = \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k
$$
There are many tests to check for convergence of a series. Some notable/useful ones are listed here:

- [[Comparison Test for Series]]
- [[Ratio Test]]
- [[Cauchy Condensation Test]]
- [[Kummer's Test]]
- [[Raabe's Test]]
- [[Alternating Series Test]]
