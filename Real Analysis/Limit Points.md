For $A$ in a [[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]], the limit points of $A$, denoted $A'$, are defined as all points $z$ such that all [[Neighborhoods]] intersect $A$ at a point other than $z$.

Every point in $A$ that is not a limit point is defined to be an isolated point.

If in addition to being a HTS, we have a [[Metric Spaces]], then there is a sequential interpretation of the limit points: $x \in A'$ if and only if
$$
x = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n \ \text{for some sequence } (x_n) \text{ of distinct points in } A.
$$
