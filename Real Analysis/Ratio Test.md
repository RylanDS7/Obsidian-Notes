For $S = \sum_n a_n$ with all $a_n \neq 0$:

If $\limsup_n \big| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\big| < 1$ then S converges absolutely.

If $\liminf_n \big| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\big| > 1$ then S diverges.

The derivation for this test involves constructing a recursive nesting of elements in the limit and invoking convergence of [[Geometric Series]].
