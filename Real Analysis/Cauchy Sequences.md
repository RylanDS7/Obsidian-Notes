Cauchy sequences are sequences with a "clustering behavior". A sequence $(x_n)$ is Cauchy if

For all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m,n > N$, $|x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon$.

Every Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges although it takes some work to prove this. This is known because $\mathbb{R}$ is a [[Complete Metric Space]], in fact, this is actually the definition of a what it means to be a complete metric space.
