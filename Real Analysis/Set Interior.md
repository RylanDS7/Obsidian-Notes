The interior of a set $A$ in a [[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]] is denoted $A^o$ and is defined using sets $U$ from the [[Topology]]:
$$
A^o = \{x\in A \ : \ x\in U, \ U \subseteq A, \ \text{for some } U \in \mathcal{T}\}.
$$
It is intuitive to think that $A^o$ is the largest open subset of $A$. And so it follows that $A$ is an [[Open Sets]] if and only if $A = A^o$.
