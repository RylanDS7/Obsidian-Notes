The definition of supremum for a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ comes from the set of all upper bounds for $S$,
$$
B = \{b \in \mathbb{R} \ : \ \forall s\in S, \ s \leq b\}.
$$
Since $\mathbb{R}$ is order complete by the [[Least Upper Bound Property]], we know that either $B = \emptyset$ or there exists $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $B = [\beta, \infty)$. We define $\sup(S) = \beta$ and if $B = \emptyset$ then $\sup(S) = \infty$.

The infimum is defined analogously for the set of all lower bounds of $S$.

By construction, the supremum and infimum can also be defined in terms of the [[Least Upper Bound Property]].
