If $S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n a_n$ and

($i$) $a_0 \geq a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots$
($ii$) $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n = 0$

then $S$ converges.

The intuition behind this is that the partial sums "bounce back and forth" between two bounded points and eventually the "bounces" go to $0$.

This actual can be generalized for any bounded sequence $B_n = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n$ and $S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$. We can recover the AST from this by setting $b_n = (-1)^n$.
