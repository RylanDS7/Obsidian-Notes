The closure of a set $A$ in a [[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]] is given by
$$
\overline{A} = \big((A^c)^o\big)^c.
$$
This set is essentially the opposite of the [[Set Interior]] in that it adds all [[Boundary Points]] of the set instead of removing them. For this reason, $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed superset of $A$ and $A$ is closed if and only if $\overline{A} = A$.
