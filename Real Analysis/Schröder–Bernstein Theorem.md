For sets $A$ and $B$ with $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B| \leq |A|$ we have $|A| = |B|$.

This may seem obvious for real numbers but it is non-trivial when applied to infinite sets. An important fact used in the proof is that for nested subsets $A_0 \supseteq A_1 \supseteq A_2$ with $A_0 \sim A_2$ gives $A_0 \sim A_1 \sim A_2$.

The proof of this fact is not trivial and involves creating an infinite chain of subsets and defining a bijection from $A$ to $A_1$ using the differences between these sets.

SBT is an important corollary of this proof.

This theorem is a fundamental result of [[Set Theory]].
