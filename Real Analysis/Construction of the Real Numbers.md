We construct the real numbers from the axioms of rational numbers by defining equivalence classes of [[Cauchy Sequences]] of rational numbered elements. These equivalence classes are defined for representative value $x \in CS(\mathbb{Q})$ by
$$
R[x] = \{x' \in CS(\mathbb{Q}) : \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} |x_n'-x_n| = 0\}.
$$
In other words, rational sequences that share the same limit fall in the same equivalence class. The construction of the real numbers involves showing that the limits of the sequences in these equivalence classes can actually be any real number, so the real numbers can be fully represented by these equivalence classes, with all operations being well-defined.

The result of this construction (and the main feature of the real numbers) is the [[Least Upper Bound Property]].
