[[Dense Sets]] in $\mathbb{R}$ have the least upper bound property which is one of the defining features of the real numbers. This property guarantees that if a set $A$ has the LUBP and has some upper bound $\mu$, then the following hold with $\beta$ being the least upper bound:
$$
(i) \ \forall \alpha \in A, \alpha \leq \beta \hspace{50px} (\beta\text{ is an upper bound})
$$
$$
(ii) \ \forall \gamma \in \mathbb{R} \text{ with } \gamma < \beta, \ \exists \alpha \in A \text{ such that } \alpha > \gamma \hspace{50px} (\beta\text{ is the least upper bound}).
$$
There is an analogous definition for the greatest upper bound which applies for dense sets that are bounded below.

The important consequence of the LUBP is that the real numbers are order complete, meaning a [[Supremum and Infimum]] will always exist in the extended real line for any subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
