The family of neighborhoods of a point $x \in \mathbb{R}^k$ are given by
$$
\mathcal{N}(x) = \{S \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^k) \ : \ \text{some } U \in \mathcal{T} \text{ obeys } x \in U \subseteq S\}
$$
In other words, all of the subsets of $\mathbb{R}^k$ that contain $x$ and can be encircled by an [[Open Sets]] contained in that same subset.

There is an equivalent statement for the [[Formal Definition of Limits]] which uses neighborhoods:

$x_n \rightarrow \hat{x}$ if and only if
$$
\forall S \in \mathcal{N}(\hat{x}), \ \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ : \ \forall n > N, x_n \in S.
$$
