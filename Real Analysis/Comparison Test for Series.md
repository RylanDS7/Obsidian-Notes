For sequences with $|a_n| \leq b_n$ for all $n$ then:

If $\sum_n b_n$ converges, so does $\sum_n a_n$.

If $\sum_n |a_n| = + \infty$, then $\sum_n b_n= + \infty$.

This definition actually also works for $n$ just sufficiently large, not necessarily for all $n$.

A useful corollary states that absolute convergence of a series implies convergence of the original.

This test is often useful if you can find some [[p-Series]] which converges and bounds the series you are studying in the limit.
