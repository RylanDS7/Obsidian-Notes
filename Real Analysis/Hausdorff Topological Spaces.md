Hausdorff Topological Spaces (HTS) are topological spaces which obey the first 3 general axioms for topological spaces plus one additional axiom. HTS results and theorems define a large portion of general [[Set Theory]]. A HTS always consists of a set $X$ and a family $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the [[Topology]]. The HTS axioms are as follows:

HTS1: Both $\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$ and $X \in \mathcal{T}$

HTS2: Any union of open sets is open. That is, for any subset $\mathcal{G}$ of $\mathcal{T}$, one has $\bigcup \mathcal{G} \in \mathcal{T}$.

HTS3: Any intersection of finitely many open sets is open. That is, if $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $U_1, \dots, U_N \in \mathcal{T}$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_N \in \mathcal{T}$.

HTS4: Whenever $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$, there exists disjoint $U, V \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$.

Every [[Metric Spaces]] is always a HTS so any HTS theorems will apply for metric spaces (notably $\mathbb{R}$).

There is a variation on the HTS axioms that are written in terms of [[Closed Sets]] which say that any intersection of closed sets is closed and and finite union of closed sets is closed.
