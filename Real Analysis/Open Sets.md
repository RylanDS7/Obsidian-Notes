Open sets are generally defined as all sets contained within the topology of a given space.

In the usual topology for $\mathbb{R}^k$, a set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ is open if for all $x \in U$, there exists $r > 0$ where $\mathbb{B}[x, r) \subseteq U$. In the notation, $\mathbb{B}[x, r)$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$.
