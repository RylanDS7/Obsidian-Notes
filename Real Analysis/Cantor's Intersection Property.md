In any [[Metric Spaces]] ($X,d)$, the following are equivalent:

(a) $(X,d)$ is a [[Complete Metric Space]].

(b) For every nested sequence of closed set $F_1 \supseteq F_2 \supseteq F_3 \supseteq \dots$ in $X$, each nonempty and satisfying diam($F_n) \rightarrow 0$, the infinite intersection:
$$
F = \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}F_n
$$
contains exactly one point.

A corollary of this is that every [[Compact Sets]] in a metric space is also complete.
