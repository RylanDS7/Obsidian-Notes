For [[Metric Spaces]] $X$ and $Y$, we define $f: X \rightarrow Y$ to be uniformly continuous if and only if
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \ \exists \delta > 0 \ : \ \forall x \in X, \ \forall t\in \mathbb{B}[x, \delta), \ d_Y(f(x'), f(x)) < \varepsilon.
$$
This definition varies from the typical [[Continuous Functions]] in that the same $\delta$ has to work for all points.

We know for sure that our function $f$ will be uniformly continuous if $X$ is a [[Compact Sets]].
