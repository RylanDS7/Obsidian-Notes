A metric space is a [[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]] with a specified function $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is called a metric. A function is a metric if it satisfies the following $\forall x,y,z \in X$:

(a) $d(x,y) \geq 0$ ($d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x=y$)
(b) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
(c) $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

The metric space is defined by the space $X$, and the metric $d$, to make $(X,d)$ with the [[Topology]] coming from the usual topology laid out for [[Open Sets]] when a metric is available.
