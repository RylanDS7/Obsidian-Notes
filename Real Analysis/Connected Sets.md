A set $S$ in a [[Hausdorff Topological Spaces]] is disconnected if there exists disjoint nonempty $U_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $S = U_1 \cup U_2$.

If no such disconnection of $S$ exists, then $S$ is a connected set.

On the real line, every connected set must be an interval.

If a [[Continuous Functions]] $f$ is applied to a connected function $X$, then we know $f(X)$ is also connected.

A corollary of this is the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]].
