If $f: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[Continuous Functions]] and $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \in (a,b)$, then there exists some $z \in (a,b)$ satisfying
$$
f'(z) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.
$$
This is a very significant conclusion that is a primary building block for the [[First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]].
