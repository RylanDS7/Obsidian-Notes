The Ampère-Maxwell Law describes how magnetic fields are dictated by electric currents (more generally this includes the [[Displacement Current]] which is a changing electric field):

$$
\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \bigg(\vec{J} + \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}\bigg)
$$

Using [[Stokes Theorem]] this can be written in integral form as 

$$
\oint_{\partial S} \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = - \int_S \mu_0 \bigg(\vec{J} + \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}\bigg)\cdot d\vec{A}
$$
