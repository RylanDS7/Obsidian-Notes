This law effectively states that there are no magnetic monopoles. In other words, the net flow of magnetic field through any closed surface must always be zero:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0
$$

Integrating over a volume on both sides and applying the [[Divergence Theorem]] gives the integral form:

$$
0 = \iint_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
