A set of four partial differential equations that are at the core of classical electromagnetism. These equations are the following:

[[Gauss's Law]]: $\hspace{30px} \nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_o}$

[[Gauss's Law (Magnetism)]]: $\hspace{30px} \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$

[[Faraday's Law]]: $\hspace{30px} \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$

[[Ampère-Maxwell Law]]: $\hspace{30px} \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \bigg(\vec{J} + \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}\bigg)$

These equation encode all the information that describes how electromagnetic systems behave within given boundary conditions and can be used to solve essentially any charge distribution (in theory).
