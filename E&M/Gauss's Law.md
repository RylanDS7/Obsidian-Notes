Gauss's Law is

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_o}
$$

for charge density $\rho$ and permittivity of free space $\varepsilon_0$. This equation dictates how electric fields behave for a given charge distribution by requiring that electric field is only created or destroyed at charged "points". Integrating over a volume on both sides and applying the [[Divergence Theorem]] gives the integral form of Gauss's Law:

$$
\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0} = \iint_S \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$
