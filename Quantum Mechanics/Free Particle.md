A free particle is a a particle in a system where $V=0$ meaning the [[The Hamiltonian Operator]] is
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}
$$
The spectrum of energies for a free particle is not quantized since there are infinite solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions.

Due to the infinite spectrum of possibly measurable values, you will never be able to measure position with perfect accuracy, and if you do, then momentum will be infinitely unknown. This fact illustrates the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal]].
