Entangled states are states that have added together in such a way that their measurement values are coupled together. A typical example is the singlet state for the two spin vectors of multiple [[Fermions]]:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|\uparrow, \downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow, \uparrow\rangle\big)
$$
We can see that for this state the only possibilities are up+down or down+up, meaning the spin vectors of the two particles must always be anti-aligned and if you measure one you know the other.

This is exactly the state that electrons occupy when filling the shells of atoms in the periodic table. For helium, there are two electrons in the same spatial state so they are forced to take on the singlet spin state above to maintain fermion anti-symmetry. This leads to the two electrons in helium being spin up and spin down, and never pointing in the same direction, as the [[Pauli Exclusion Principal]] predicts.
