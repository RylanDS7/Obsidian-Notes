The hydrogen atom is a good potential to study because it shows what happens in a single proton, single electron system. The potential in this case is radially symmetric and is proportional to $1/r$.

[[The Hamiltonian Operator]] for this potential generates a [[Schrödinger Equation]] given by
$$
Eu(r) = -\frac{\hbar}{2m}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \bigg(V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{r^2}\bigg)u(r)
$$
where $u(r) = rR(r)$ where $R(r)$ is the [[Central Potentials]] radial solution.

The radial solutions are given by
$$
R_{n, \ell} \propto \bigg(\frac{r}{a}\bigg)^\ell\text{exp}\bigg(-\frac{r}{(n + \ell +1)a}\bigg)L_n^{(2\ell + 1)}\bigg(\frac{2r}{(n + \ell +1)a}\bigg)
$$
where $a$ is the Bohr radius and $N = n + \ell + 1$ is the principal quantum number.

The $L$ functions are the Associated [[Laguerre Polynomials]].

The energies of these states are given by
$$
E_N = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2ma^2N^2}
$$
