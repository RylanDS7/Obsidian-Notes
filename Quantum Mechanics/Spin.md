Spin is form of intrinsic [[Angular Momentum (Quantum)]] that is inherent in most fundamental particles (almost all except Higgs Boson).

It is derived from the same formalism as angular momentum which makes no assumptions about physical angular momentum.

This means specifying spin means specifying a quantum number for $S^2$ and one for $S_z$ (or any other component) in the same way as for angular momentum.

As with angular momentum, particles can have integer or half integer spin.
If a particle has a half-integer spin it is designated a [[Fermions]], if it has an integer spin it is designated a [[Bosons]].

For Fermions with $S^2 = 1/2$ we have a [[Hilbert Space]] of two [[Eigenfunctions]], up or down spin measurements. This is the most typical system in nature (electrons, neutrons, etc).

In the $S_z$ basis, the [[Operators]] that measure the spin components are given as the [[Pauli Matricies]]:
$$
S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{30px} S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{30px} S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{pmatrix}
$$
With the following up/down eigenvectors:
$$
| \uparrow_z\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{30px} | \downarrow_z\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
| \uparrow_x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{30px} | \downarrow_x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
| \uparrow_y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ i\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{30px} | \downarrow_y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -i\end{pmatrix}
$$
There is a visual representation of the spin state of a spin-$1/2$ fermion as a 3D vector on the [[Bloch Sphere]], which translates the 2D vector into spherical coordinate angles using the following formula:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(\theta) \\ e^{i \phi}\sin(\theta) \end{pmatrix}
$$
