Fermions are fundamental particles with half integer spin.

For 2 fermions in a two particle system, the combined state must be anti-symmetric under the exchange operator.

Because of the way [[Tensor Products]] propagate symmetry, this means that there are two allowed possibilities for multi fermion systems:

- Symmetric spatial state and anti-symmetric angular momentum/spin state
- Anti-symmetric spatial state and symmetric angular momentum/spin state

Either of these will result in a anti-symmetric total state, as is the requirement for fermions. The [[Angular Momentum (Quantum)]] state is the sum of physical angular momentum and [[Spin]] of the particles.

The result above implies that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state which is essentially the [[Pauli Exclusion Principal]].

This principal is essential in determining how electrons fill the shells of increasingly larger elements in the periodic table.
