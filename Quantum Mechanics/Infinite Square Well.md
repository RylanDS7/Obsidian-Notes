For an infinite square well potential, the [[The Hamiltonian Operator]] is given by
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}
$$
inside the well and infinity outside the well.

This is the simplest case of the [[Schrödinger Equation]] where the solutions are just
$$
\psi(x) = Asin(kx) + Bcos(kx)
$$
with $k = \frac{n \pi}{L}$ for the width of the well being $L$.

The energies of these states are given by
$$
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2mL}
$$
These wavefunctions will always go to $0$ at the boundaries of the well due to the infinite potential barrier. If we have a [[Finite Square Well]], the wavefunction taper off at the boundaries instead.
