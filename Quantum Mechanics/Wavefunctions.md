The wavefunction of a quantum mechanical systems describes the "state" of the system in the position basis. Taking the wavefunction values to define the components of the position basis we get the state vector for the system.

The state vector can be measured by applying acting on it with an [[Operators]]. In the case of a measurement for an operator being taken, the only possible measurable results are the [[Eigenvalues]] of the operator. The coefficient of the corresponding [[Eigenfunctions]] when the normalized state vector is expressed in the basis of the operator can be squared to give the probability of attaining that value.

This means that if a given state vector can be expressed as a single eigenfunction for an operator, then we know we will measure that eigenvalue with certainty. Otherwise, there is always a probability spectrum of possible measurements. We can take the [[Expectation Value]] for the operator to determine the weighted average of the possible measurements.

The time dependence of wavefunctions can be determined by expressing the state vector in the basis of [[The Hamiltonian Operator]].
