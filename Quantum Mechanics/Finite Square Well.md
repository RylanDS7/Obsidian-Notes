For an infinite square well potential, the [[The Hamiltonian Operator]] is given by
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}
$$
inside the well and
$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V_0
$$
outside the well.

This means outside the well, we are solving an [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] that looks like this:
$$
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x) = \frac{2m(V_0-E)}{\hbar^2}\psi(x)
$$
The solutions to this will depend on the sign of $V_0 - E$. If $E > V_0$ then the wavefunction will behave like a [[Free Particle]], otherwise we will get decaying real exponentials.

The energies for bound states are quantized and are found by solving for the wavenumber inside the well.
The energies of the unbound states take on a continuous spectra.
