Ehrenfest Theorem uses [[The Hamiltonian Operator]] with [[Commutators]] to find time dependence of the expectation value for a general operator $\hat{A}$. It is given by
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{i}{\hbar}\big\langle [\hat{H}, \hat{A}]\big\rangle + \bigg\langle\frac{\partial\hat{A}}{\partial t}\bigg\rangle
$$
When $\hat{A}$ is not time dependent (which is often the case), then the last term is $0$ which shows that the time evolution of the measuring the operator is dependent on the commutator with the Hamiltonian.

This theorem is essentially the quantum mechanical expression of the same theorem expressed classically for [[The Hamiltonian]] using [[Poisson Brackets]].

Both of these interpretations shed light on why an operator or observable is independent of time when it commutes with the Hamiltonian.
