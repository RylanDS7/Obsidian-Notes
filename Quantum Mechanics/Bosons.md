Bosons are fundamental particles with integer spin.

For 2 bosons in a two particle system, the combined state must be symmetric under the exchange operator.

Because of the way [[Tensor Products]] propagate symmetry, this means that there are two allowed possibilities for multi boson systems:

- Symmetric spatial state and symmetric angular momentum/spin state
- Anti-symmetric spatial state and anti-symmetric angular momentum/spin state
