The Hamiltonian operator is the operator corresponding to [[The Hamiltonian]] observable.

Like the observable, the Hamiltonian operator represents the total energy of the system (generally). 

The Hamiltonian operator determines time dependence and has energy for eigenvalues, so it gives rise to the [[Schrödinger Equation]].

This means if you find all the [[Eigenfunctions]] and [[Eigenvalues]] of the Hamiltonian you know everything you need to find the time dependence of [[Wavefunctions]] in the system you are looking at.

For eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$ being $E_1, E_2, \dots$ we can write the time dependent wavefunction in terms of the eigenfunctions in the $\hat{H}$ basis. $\psi_1(x), \psi_2(x), \dots$
$$
\Psi(x, t) = \sum_n c_n \psi_n(x)e^{-\frac{iE_nt}{\hbar}}
$$
where $c_n$ constants are determined by the wavefunction given at $t=0$.
