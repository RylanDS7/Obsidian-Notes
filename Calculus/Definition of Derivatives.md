The derivative of a function $f: [x_0, x_1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is defined to
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x-c}
$$
using the the [[Formal Definition of Limits]]. The function is said to be differentiable at $x$ if the above limit exists and is finite.

The value of the derivative at the endpoints is defined by the one-sided limits that stay within the domain.
