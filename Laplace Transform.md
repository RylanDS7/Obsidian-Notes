The Laplace Transform is often used as a way to simplify integration and derivation in the time domain making it possible to solve [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] algebraically. The Laplace transform can also be sometimes be thought of as giving the long term behavior of a function although this is somewhat an oversimplification.

The Laplace transform can be calculated with the formula

$$
\mathcal{L}\{f\}(s)=\int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-st}dt
$$

where $s$ is a complex frequency-domain parameter given by $s = \sigma +i\omega$.

Under certain conditions, the Laplace Transform with a purely imaginary argument becomes equal to the [[Fourier Transform]].
