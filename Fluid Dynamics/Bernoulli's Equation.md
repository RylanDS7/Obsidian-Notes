Bernoulli's equation is essentially energy conservation applied along a streamline of a flowing fluid. This equation states that along a streamline at the same height, a pressure increase leads to a velocity decrease and vice versa. It is stated mathematically between two points as

$$
\frac{V_1^2}{2} + \frac{P_1}{\rho} +gz_1 = \frac{V_2^2}{2} + \frac{P_2}{\rho} +gz_2
$$

Since this equation is only applicable along the streamline of a frictionless, irrotational flow, it is primarily applied to [[Laminar Flow]] in a non-skinny pipe.

When used in applications involving pumps or turbines we need to consider the [[General Energy Equation]] instead.
