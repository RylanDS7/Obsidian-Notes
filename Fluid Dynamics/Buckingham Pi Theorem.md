The Buckingham Pi Theorem states that any problem with a meaningful relationship between $n$ physical variables can be expressed as a relationship between $p = n - k$ dimensionless groups where $k$ is the number of primary (physical) dimensions present. This allows us to reduce a function of several variables to a function of less parameters where the parameters are ratios of the original variables such that all ratios are dimensionless.

This theorem is very important for experiential physics because it allows the experimenter to reduce the problem to a smaller set of parameters which increases the efficiency of the procedure and allows for easier interpretation of results.

Some notable dimensionless groups are:
- [[Reynolds Number]]
- Mach Number
- Lift Coefficient
- Drag Coefficient
