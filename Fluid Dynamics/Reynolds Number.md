The Reynolds Number is a dimensionless group that characterizes whether a given flow is [[Laminar Flow]] or [[Turbulent Flow]] based on the velocity, density, dynamic viscosity, and effective diameter. The Reynolds number for a given flow can be found as

$$
Re = \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}
$$

If the Reynolds number is less than 2300 we have laminar flow, if it is greater than 4000 we have turbulent flow, and anything in between is considered transitional flow.
