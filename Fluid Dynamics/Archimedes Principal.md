The vertical [[Hydrostatic Force]] on a submerged object is determined by the submerged volume of the object and the density of the fluid.

$$
F_b = \rho gV_{sub}
$$

This force acts upwards through the centroid of the displaced volume.

The centroid is often called the center of buoyancy in this context. When there is an object with non-uniformly distributed mass, the center of gravity and center of buoyancy no longer line up leading the hydrostatic force and gravitational force to generate a moment that is either restoring or overturning. The stability of the object is determined by whether the moment leads to corrective rotation or flipping.
