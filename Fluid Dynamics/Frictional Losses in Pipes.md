Using [[Conservation of Momentum (fluids)]] we can determine what the pressure drop generated by frictional losses are along a segment of straight pipe. This is found by

$$
P_1 - P_2 = 4\tau_w \frac{L}{D}
$$

Where $\tau_w$ is the shear stress of the flow at the walls of the pipe. Since the pressure drop is $\rho g h_L$ we can see that

$$
h_L = \frac{4\tau_w}{\rho g} \frac{L}{D}
$$

$\tau_w$ can be put in terms of a Darcy Friction factor $f$ so that 

$$
h_L = f\frac{L}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g}
$$

We now need to solve for the friction factor which is dependent on the [[Reynolds Number]] and the roughness of the pipe.

For [[Laminar Flow]] we can neglect the dependence on the roughness and find that

$$
f = \frac{64}{Re}
$$

which is only true for circular pipe. For other geometries there is a different number in the numerator.

For [[Turbulent Flow]] we can solve for $f$ iteratively using a Moody Chart.
