The dynamic viscosity coefficient is essentially the scaling that relates the rate of change of the velocity profile of a liquid to the shear stress at the walls. For velocity $u$ as a function of distance $y$, the dynamic viscosity coefficient $\mu$ governs the relationship

$$
\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}
$$

This definition of viscosity can be used to find the shear stress at walls very easily given the velocity profile and permitting the no slip condition assumption. 

It is also used to calculate [[Reynolds Number]], one of the most important dimensionless groups to analyzing fluid flow.
