The hydrostatic force is the force that acts on a submerged object in a stationary fluid. This force arises from hydrostatic pressure acting on a surface which is defined entirely by the depth in the fluid relative to some reference point (usually the surface) and is given by

$$
\Delta P = \rho gh
$$

On a given surface, the force acts through the [[Center of Pressure]] of the object and is calculated by the integral of the pressure along the surface. For a vertical plate the integral evaluates to the pressure value at $\frac{1}{2}$ of the plate's height multiplied by the total area of the plate. In this case it will act at $\frac{2}{3}$ the height of the plate which is the center of pressure. In general for an angled plate, the hydrostatic force assuming gage pressure is

$$
F = \rho g h_{CG} A
$$

and it acts perpendicular to the plate and through the center of pressure which can be found by the equations

$$
y_{CP} = -sin(\theta)\frac{I_{xx}}{h_{CG}A} \qquad \qquad x_{CP} = -sin(\theta)\frac{I_{xy}}{h_{CG}A}
$$

for $\theta$ measured from the surface of the fluid to the $y$ coordinate of the plane.

For complicated curved surfaces these forces can be calculated by taking a free body diagram of the water section in contact with the desired surface such that the other edges are vertical and horizontal plates. The forces on the curve can then be solved by finding the forces on the flat boundaries of the water section which are much easier to solve.

In some situations you can also find the forces on curved surfaces by using [[Archimedes Principal]] to find the force acting upward through the centroid of a displaced volume.
